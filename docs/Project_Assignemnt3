Our team considered multiple technology stacks, including Node and Django, when deciding on the best option for our project. 
Ultimately, we chose the MERN stack due to its simplicity and familiarity with Javascript, as well as its popularity and large community of developers.

The MERN stack offers a comprehensive solution for building modern web applications, with MongoDB for flexibility and scalability, 
ExpressJS for server-side application development, NodeJS for fast and non-blocking I/O programming, and ReactJS for dynamic user interfaces. 
We believe that the MERN stack will provide us with the tools and flexibility we need to build a high-performance web application that meets 
our project requirements.
